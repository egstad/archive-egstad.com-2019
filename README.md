# Egstad Dotcom

![Nuxt.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/nuxt-2.9.2-brightgreen) [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/57ac0b66-bcdb-47f1-a82c-1a364b1e5f4f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/egstad/deploys)

> **My little corner of the internet.**

## Overview
At a high-level, this site is a blend of [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/), and [Prismic](https://prismic.io/docs/javascript/getting-started/integrating-with-an-existing-javascript-project). Nuxt consumes data from Prismic and handles the static-generation of the app. Once pushed to github, Netlify (or a similar service) will continuously deploy the site.
